# About 
This application, deployed via Heroku on January 29, 2020, was built using React.js, React Router, React Hooks, HTML and CSS. At it's most basic level it allows the user to view a picture a day accompanied by a title, the date and a brief explanation of the image. The user can also search for a specific date by using the search form feature. This application uses data generously provided by NASA's public API.

# Planning Process
This project was an excellent experience overall. As I planned and built the application I felt challenged to really consider the user's experience. My planning process began with basic wireframe sketches and I was able to quickly scaffold my project from there.

# Personal Deployment Checklist 
- Does the application complete a GET request from third party API? √
- Does it display data in a thoughtful, easily navigable way? √
- Is it an application that I would use? √

# Possible Future Updates
- The NASA API seems a bit shaky at times and it would benefit the user if there was an error screen that displayed if no data came from the GET request
